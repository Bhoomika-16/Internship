# Internship
 The goal of the project is to design a python-based 
gaming application of the game “Jimmy: The police dog” from scratch. For the project, we 
decided to design a 2D Platformer game where the objective of the game is to catch the thief. 
The user played as a dog, has to avoid the obstacles and, collect coins and powerups to defeat 
the thief and win the game. The game is designed in a windows environment and written in 
python using PyCharm as IDE, integrated with pygame and Tkinter libraries. For the project, 
several programming modules as discussed and designed in the course of the internship are 
implemented. As a result, a 2-D game that is simple to understand and fun to play is created.
